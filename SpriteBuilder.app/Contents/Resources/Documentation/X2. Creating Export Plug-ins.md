# SpriteBuilder - Create export plug-in

SpriteBuilder has support for creating custom export plug-ins. Bundled with SpriteBuilder comes the default ccbi-exporter, but it is easy to add new output formats.


## Setup a new plug-in project

The easiest way to setup a new plug-in project is to duplicate and rename the example plug-in. Open up the _PlugIn Exporters_ folder and duplicate the _Export Example_ folder. Rename it to what you want your new export plug-in to be called.

Now open the Xcode project in the new folder. Rename the project by slowly clicking twice on the project's name. The name you use here is what will be displayed in the save dialog when selecting _Publish Asâ€¦_ in SpriteBuilder.

You will now be asked to rename various project content items. Keep everything selected and click the _Rename_ button.

The plug-in uses a custom class to export your SpriteBuilder document. This class's name needs to be unique for each plug-in. Therefore, you will need to rename the plug-in's main class. The easisest way to do this is by opening the file, right clicking on the class's name and selecting _Refactor_ -> _Rename_.

Enter a name that corresponds to your plug-in's name and use the _CCBX_ prefix. You will also need to open the Info.plist file and change the _Principal class_ property to the name of your new class.

To compile and test the plug-in, first make sure that you have built a copy of SpriteBuilder and that it is located in the _build_ directory. Then click the _Run_ button in the plug-in project. This will compile the plug-in and copy it into SpriteBuilder's PlugIns folder (inside the app bundle). For testing and debugging, double click the SpriteBuilder program in the build directory. You can see the output of the program using Console.app. Set the filter to SpriteBuilder to avoid output from other applications.


## Write the plug-in

The export plug-in is very simple in its structure. Its main class should contain two methods that SpriteBuilder will call. The first method, _extension_, simply returns a string with the extension that the exported file should use. For instance, this is what the default ccbi exporter uses.

    - (NSString*) extension
    {
        return @"ccbi";
    }
    
The second method, _exportDocument:_ is where all the magic of the exporter happens. It will receive an NSDictionary that contains the complete document. The document structure can be found in the _CCB File Format_. The _exportDocument:_ should create and return an autoreleased NSData object with the contents of the file to export. The example file uses NSPropertyListSerialization to create a plist representation of the document (same as ccb file save).

    - (NSData*) exportDocument:(NSDictionary*)doc
    {
        return [NSPropertyListSerialization dataFromPropertyList:doc format:NSPropertyListBinaryFormat_v1_0 errorDescription:NULL];
    }
